# Layout Shift GIF Generator - CLI

[https://defaced.dev/tools/layout-shift-gif-generator/](https://defaced.dev/tools/layout-shift-gif-generator/)

Visualise the Core Web Vitals metric Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) with a simple GIF.

Lighthouse is a great tool for identifying your overall Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score, but it's not so great for quickly visualising what's actually shifting on a page. The Layout Shift GIF Generator allows you to quickly identify which elements are moving around in the viewport.

## Getting Started

### Installation

The Layout Shift GIF Generator command line tool can be installed directly from NPM.

`npm install -g layout-shift-gif`

### Usage

Once installed the tool can be used as per the following example.

`layout-shift-gif --url https://blacklivesmatter.com/ --device mobile --output layout-shift.gif`

This will generate an animated `layout-shift.gif` of `https://blacklivesmatter.com/` showing the regions of Cumulative Layout Shift on the viewport of a simulated `mobile` device.

### Device Simulation

The tool is able to check both a desktop and a mobile viewport.

- _The `desktop` viewport is a standard 1920x1080 resolution._

- _The `mobile` viewport is the Nexus 5X profile from Lighthouse._

Both the CPU and the network are throttled simulating a `good 3G network`.

## Hosted Version

If you don't wish to use the CLI version there is also a free hosted version running in a cloud function available on [defaced.dev](https://defaced.dev/tools/layout-shift-gif-generator/)

## Understanding The GIF

### Page Screenshot

The screenshot of the page is taken after all the page elements have shifted and the CLS has been calculated.

### Border Style

The border style of an outlined element represents the start and end positions of the elements shift.

- _A dashed border indicates the element's starting position._

- _A solid border indicates the element's end position._

### Border Colour

The border colour of an outlined element represents the CLS score of that element against the overall page thresholds for CLS outlined by Google.

ðŸŸ¢ Good â‰¤0.1  

ðŸŸ  Needs Improvement 	

ðŸ”´ Poor >0.25 

This means that if you see a shifting element with a red or orange outline then this element alone is contributing significantly to a negative CLS score for that page.

### Corner Metric

The metric in the top left corner is the overall CLS score for that page and is the score you'll see in Lighthouse or Pagespeed Insights.

### Corner Colour

The colour of the top left corner represents where the pages overall CLS score fits within the thresholds for CLS outlined by Google.
